# Test-Driven Learning: SyncPromise

A thorough set of unit tests have been created for you.  Now you just need to make them pass!

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/jason-whitted/tdl-syncpromise
cd tdl-syncpromise
npm install
```

## Directions
You will be working in the `src/SyncPromise.js` file.  This _should_ be the ***ONLY*** file you need to change.

Utilize documentation and unit tests to help you create a synchronous promise object.

### [SyncPromise Documentation](SyncPromise.md)
Read the docs!  You don't have to fully comprehend it initially, but it is good to get familiar with the documentation.

### Run Unit Tests
You can test your work using `npm test`.  Once the unit tests pass, you're done!

When you are finished you can run `npm run test:cov` to generate code coverage.  Then take a look at `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.
